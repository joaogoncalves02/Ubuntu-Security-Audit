1. Open a terminal window.
2. Download the script to the local machine using the following command: wget https://url/to/script/ubuntu-security-audit.sh.
3. Make the script executable using the following command: sudo chmod +x ubuntu_security_check.sh.
4. Run the script using the following command: sudo ./ubuntu_security_check.sh.
5. The script will update the package list, upgrade installed packages, and check for security vulnerabilities, open ports, rootkit infections, firewall and SSH configurations, Sudoers file permissions, cron jobs, file permissions, password strength, and outdated software. It will then provide possible solutions for the detected issues.
