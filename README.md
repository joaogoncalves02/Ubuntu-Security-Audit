# Ubuntu-Security-Audit
The Ubuntu Security Checker is a shell script that audits an Ubuntu system for security vulnerabilities and provides recommendations to improve its security. It checks for rootkit infections, open ports, firewall and SSH configurations, file permissions, password strength, and outdated software. Ideal for system engineers and administrators.
